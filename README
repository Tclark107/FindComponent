FindComponents
This is a project using and adding to my Graph ADT from my FindParts 
project.  This project will find the strongly connected components of
a directional graph.

I have worked on this project for about: 1.5 hours
thus far. 

Graph.c and Graph.h
I will use my previously made Graph ADT and add on to it. I am adding a 
transpose function, a copyGraph function and a Depth First Search function.

FindComponents.c
Finds the strongly connected components of a Graph.
